# CodeFlowMapper

What is CodeFlowMapper?
CodeFlowMapper is an open-source tool designed to help developers quickly understand and visualize Python codebases. It generates flowcharts and entity diagrams that illustrate the relationships between functions within Python files or entire directories.

## Features

- Analyze single Python files or entire directories
- Generate visual flowcharts of function calls
- Provide a clear overview of code structure
- Support for Python projects (currently limited to Python files)

## Current Limitations

- Only supports Python files and directories
- Does not yet handle complex Python features like decorators or lambda functions
- Limited to static analysis; dynamic code generation or evaluation is not supported

## Future Plans

- Extend support to other programming languages (C, C++, JavaScript, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Improve visualization options and interactivity
- Add support for more complex Python language features
- Implement a user-friendly GUI or web interface
